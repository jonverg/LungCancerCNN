Lung cancer is a formidable global health challenge, necessitating precise lesion
classification to optimize treatment strategies for early diagnosis.

Our CNN model demonstrated remarkable accuracy in discriminating between benign and malignant lesions (97%), and strong accuracy in classifying different lung cancer types (76%).

This research provides a foundation for future investigations and innovations aimed at diagnostic methodologies and therapeutic interventions in the pursuit of improved patient outcomes.
